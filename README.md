# Support-Vector-Machines-with-R
I am going to show you how to use Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to solve classification problem. For full article about SVMs with R, feel free to visit https://learndatascienceskill.com/index.php/2020/07/15/support-vector-machines-svms-with-r/

Today we are going to focus on a classification problem in which we are given the data of Iris Versicolor, Iris Setosa and Iris Virginica. These 3 species of flowers look very similar physically and it is difficult to differentiate them even with human eyes. We are going to apply SVMs to this problem with using R programming.

At the end of our analysis, we will get a trained SVM model which is able to predict the species of an unknown data (response variable or dependent variable) based on the input attributes (also known as explanatory variables). We are going to review on 4 different input attributes, including Petal length, Petal width, Sepal length and Sepal width, and determine which variables are more useful and accurate to be used in SVMs to identify the best hyperplane.
